# Introduction
This is a repository for learning the basics of Large Language Models (LLMs).

I will implement some fundamental LLMs to gain a deeper understanding of their inner workings.

Planned tasks:
- [x] Transformer architecture
- [x] Llama2 implementation
- [ ] Vision Language Models (VLM)
- [ ] LoRa fine-tuning
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- [ ] Other related knowledge areas
